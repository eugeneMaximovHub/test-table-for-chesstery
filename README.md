# Basic table

This is a test table made for a task from [Chesster](https://chesstery.com/) and developed  with the help of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scripts used

1.	[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for quick design of adaptivity
2.	[Lodash](https://lodash.com/) for ordering elements
3.	[MirageJS](https://miragejs.com/) to create a fake API

## Development

### `stylization`

Style is not meets the requirements

### `refactoring`

Refactoring the entire application extract method.
